Final Project


The statistic I chose to evaluate players with mainly deals with how efficient the player is with regard to how many time that player strikeouts. I was really interested in this statistic because when I watch guys like Aaron Judge or Giancarlo Stanton for example I either see a massive home run or they get a strikeout. However, I will not only be looking at home runs, but also other statistics such as hits, runs, and runners batted in. This is so I can see all the other ways a player can contribute compared to the number of times they strikeout. I will be using the Lahman database to get my data because it has all the players information and the statistics that I will need to use. I will only be using the data from 1991 – 2017 just because my crashed when I ran the sql query for more than those amounts of years. 
To compare how players are doing I will look at the league average for that year and see who is above and below the average to see how efficient they have been compared to the average. 
This statistic is comparable to batting average except instead of dividing by the number of at bats I am dividing by the number of strikeouts. I wanted to see the ratio a player has for different offensive statistics to number of strikeouts. I will be using a correlation test between Hits Per Strikeout and Batting Average to evaluate my Strikeout Efficiency statistic. 
When looking through different baseball statistics I was never able to find one that uses strikeouts as the main focus, so I wanted to see what I could do with it. I think this would be a good statistic because it shows how efficient the player is based on the number of strikeouts they received in the year. Also with my demonstration you will be able to see if players have improved or declined throughout the years. So, you will be able to see if players are becoming more efficient per strikeout, or getting worse. A
In the Final Project Word Document, there is an example of Nolan Arenado and his statistics throughout the years.
